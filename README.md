# About me ðŸ’«
Hello, my nickname is Deadly or DeadlyFirex. I'm a 19 year old software engineer from the Netherlands, I've been an enthusiastic programmer since the age of 14, and I'm fascinated by software, embedded systems, backend development, Linux and microservices.

I have strong confidence in most backend-centric languages, such as Java, Python and C# / C++.
I mostly develop for small local startups and local businesses to simplify their processes, although I also develop open-source software.

Besides programming, I love reading, swimming, experiementing with embedded systems, videogaming and listening to music!
