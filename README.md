### Hello there! :wave:

Hi, I'm **Deadly**, an energentic (backend) software engineer.\
Currently a passionate _Arch Linux_ user, penetration-tester in-training. Learning how to use machine learning, specifically interested about neural networks with PyTorch.

I code as a software engineer for my job, in my spare time to improve my knowledge, publicly and on private repos, and for fun.\
I also code projects for (local) organizations or people.
